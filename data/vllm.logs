Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:
"""
the environment information around:
The summary of the environment info:
**Entity:** Alice is located at position [-4, -60, 1] and is holding one wheat seed.
**Blocks:** 
- A chest at position [-5, -60, 0] facing north.
- Water at position [-5, -61, 0].
- Dirt at position [-5, -62, 0].
**Creatures:** 
- A cod at position [0, -60, 0].
- A salmon at position [1, -60, 1].
- A pufferfish at position [2, -60, 0].
- A sheep at position [-3, -59, 6].
- A cow at position [-3, -59, 6].
- A rabbit at position [-2, -59, 6].
**Interactive-Items:** None mentioned (e.g., no crafting table or furnace in the given environment info).
To complete the task, Alice needs to move to the sheep's location at [-3, -59, 6] and feed it with the wheat seeds she is holding.
Sign info: 


The high-level task:
{'description': 'Move to the nearby sheep and feed it with wheat seeds.', 'meta-data': {'milestones': ['Find a sheep within 10 blocks', 'Feed the sheep with wheat seeds']}}


Agent ability: (This is just telling you what the agent can do in one step, subtask should be harder than one step)
{'public_tools': ['MineBlock', 'placeBlock', 'scanNearbyEntities', 'get_entity_info', 'read', 'navigateTo', 'withdrawItem', 'craftBlock', 'fetchContainerContents', 'performMovement', 'get_entity_info', 'equipItem', 'UseItemOnEntity'], 'private_tools': {'Alice': []}}
"""
Your response should exclusively include the identified sub-task or the next step intended for the agent to execute.
So, 1 subtasks is the maximum number of subtasks you can give.
Response should contain a list of subtask-structure JSON.

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}

*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give a decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:
"""

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

  - Cow at position [9, -59, 9]
* Interactive-Items: None are explicitly mentioned in the environment info. However, the task mentions a wooden door that Alice needs to interact with. The position of the wooden door is not provided in the environment info.

Note: There is no mention of a chest, crafting table, or furnace in the provided environment info. The sign at the location reads "Welcome to Savanna", but its position is not specified. Plants are also not mentioned in the environment info.

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}

*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give a decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}

*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give a decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:
"""

Your response should exclusively include the identified sub-task or the next step intended for the agent to execute.
So, 1 subtasks is the maximum number of subtasks you can give.
Response should contain a list of subtask-structure JSON.

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:
"""

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}

*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give a decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:
"""

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now.

    "reasoning": str, # the reasoning process
    "summary": str, # the summary of the vital information of action history with detailed position number and other parameters, which not included in task description.
    "task_status": bool, # whether the task is completed
}


Now let's evaluate the #RL-Recommended-Action taken for this task.

Task Description:
Navigate to the farm by jumping forward for 5 seconds

Current Milestone:
['Move 5 blocks forward from current position']

Actions and Observations:

To navigate to the farm by jumping forward for 5 seconds, I need to perform the "jump forward" action for 5 seconds.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "performMovement",
  "action_input": {
    "player_name": "Alice",
    "action_name": "jump forward",
    "seconds": 5
  }
}
```

{'message': 'I cannot do this action', 'new_events': ['My inventory: wheat_seeds: 1 salmon: 1 shears: 1 heldItem: wheat_seeds '], 'status': False}

#RL-Recommended-Action:
navigateToBuilding

Please analyze:
1. Does the current #RL-Recommended-Action match the most recent LLM action? Is it reasonable?
2. Rate the #RL-Recommended-Action with a reward:
   -2: Definitely wrong
   -1: Useless/irrelevant
    0: Potentially useful
    1: Useful
    2: Highly effective
3. Has the task been completed? (true/false)

Do not include any other information in your response.
Return in JSON format directly.

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

{
    "reasoning": str, # the reasoning process
    "summary": str, # the summary of the vital information of action history with detailed position number and other parameters, which not included in task description.
    "task_status": bool, # whether the task is completed
}


Now let's evaluate the #RL-Recommended-Action taken for this task.

Task Description:
Navigate to the crafting table at position [5, -60, 0] to potentially craft wheat seeds

Current Milestone:
['Reach the crafting table within 5 seconds']

Actions and Observations:

Thought: To navigate to the crafting table at position [5, -60, 0], I need to move Alice from her current position [-2, -60, 0] to the crafting table. Since the distance is not very far, I can use the navigateTo tool to achieve this.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "navigateTo",
  "action_input": {
    "player_name": "Alice",
    "x": 5,
    "y": -60,
    "z": 0
  }
}
```

{'message': 'move failed, can not reach position 5 -60 0, the position is blocked, check the environment', 'new_events': ['An item drop at (2.4, -60.4, 0.5)', 'My inventory: tropical_fish: 1 wheat_seeds: 1 shears: 1 salmon: 1 heldItem: tropical_fish '], 'status': False}

#RL-Recommended-Action:
enchantItem

Please analyze:
1. Does the current #RL-Recommended-Action match the most recent LLM action? Is it reasonable?
2. Rate the #RL-Recommended-Action with a reward:
   -2: Definitely wrong
   -1: Useless/irrelevant
    0: Potentially useful
    1: Useful
    2: Highly effective
3. Has the task been completed? (true/false)

Do not include any other information in your response.
Return in JSON format directly.

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:
"""

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}

*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give a decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

Now let's evaluate the #RL-Recommended-Action taken for this task.

Task Description:
Navigate to the wheat location and collect 3 wheat seeds

Current Milestone:
['Reach the wheat location', 'Collect 3 wheat seeds']

Actions and Observations:

To accomplish the task of navigating to the wheat location and collecting 3 wheat seeds, I first need to move to the wheat location. The wheat is located at positions [1, -59, 1], [2, -59, 1], and [3, -59, 1]. Since I am currently at position [-1, -60, 0], I will navigate to the closest wheat position, which is [1, -59, 1].

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}

*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give a decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

Prompt : 
You are in a Minecraft world. You are a agent player. You need to use the action history compared with the task description and the milestone description to check whether the task is completed.
The check-strucutre
{
    "reasoning": str, # the reasoning process
    "summary": str, # the summary of the vital information of action history with detailed position number and other parameters, which not included in task description.
    "task_status": bool, # whether the task is completed
}


Now let's evaluate the #RL-Recommended-Action taken for this task.

Task Description:
Navigate to the location near 0, -60, 0

Current Milestone:
['Reach the position [0, -60, 0]']

Actions and Observations:

Thought: To reach the position [0, -60, 0], I need to navigate to that location. Since I am already at position [-4, -60, 1], I can move to the desired location.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "navigateTo",
  "action_input": {
    "player_name": "Alice",
    "x": 0,
    "y": -60,
    "z": 0
  }
}
```

{'message': ' move to 0 -60 0', 'new_events': ['My inventory: fishing_rod: 1 heldItem: fishing_rod '], 'status': True}

#RL-Recommended-Action:
withdrawItem

Please analyze:
1. Does the current #RL-Recommended-Action match the most recent LLM action? Is it reasonable?
2. Rate the #RL-Recommended-Action with a reward:
   -2: Definitely wrong
   -1: Useless/irrelevant
    0: Potentially useful
    1: Useful
    2: Highly effective
3. Has the task been completed? (true/false)

Do not include any other information in your response.
Return in JSON format directly.
{
    "reward": int,   # Value from -2 to 2
    "task_status": bool  # true if milestone is satisfied else false
}

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}

*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give a decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}

*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give a decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now.

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.

{
    "reasoning": str, # the reasoning process
    "summary": str, # the summary of the vital information of action history with detailed position number and other parameters, which not included in task description.
    "task_status": bool, # whether the task is completed
}


Now let's evaluate the #RL-Recommended-Action taken for this task.

Task Description:
Navigate to the location near 0, -60, 0

Current Milestone:
['Reach the position [0, -60, 0]']

Actions and Observations:

Thought: To reach the position [0, -60, 0], I need to navigate to that location. Since I am already at position [-4, -60, 1], I can move to the desired location.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "navigateTo",
  "action_input": {
    "player_name": "Alice",
    "x": 0,
    "y": -60,
    "z": 0
  }
}
```

{'message': ' move to 0 -60 0', 'new_events': ['My inventory: fishing_rod: 1 heldItem: fishing_rod '], 'status': True}

#RL-Recommended-Action:
waitForFeedback

Please analyze:
1. Does the current #RL-Recommended-Action match the most recent LLM action? Is it reasonable?
2. Rate the #RL-Recommended-Action with a reward:
   -2: Definitely wrong
   -1: Useless/irrelevant
    0: Potentially useful
    1: Useful
    2: Highly effective
3. Has the task been completed? (true/false)

Do not include any other information in your response.
Return in JSON format directly.

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

Now let's evaluate the #RL-Recommended-Action taken for this task.

Task Description:
Move to the location near 0, -60, 0

Current Milestone:
['Reach the location near 0, -60, 0']

Actions and Observations:

Thought: To reach the location near 0, -60, 0, I need to move Alice to that position. Since Alice is currently at position [-4, -60, 1], I can use the navigateTo tool to move her to the desired location.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "navigateTo",
  "action_input": {
    "player_name": "Alice",
    "x": 0,
    "y": -60,
    "z": 0
  }
}
```

{'message': ' move to 0 -60 0', 'new_events': ['My inventory: fishing_rod: 1 heldItem: fishing_rod '], 'status': True}

#RL-Recommended-Action:
handoverBlock

Please analyze:
1. Does the current #RL-Recommended-Action match the most recent LLM action? Is it reasonable?
2. Rate the #RL-Recommended-Action with a reward:
   -2: Definitely wrong
   -1: Useless/irrelevant
    0: Potentially useful
    1: Useful
    2: Highly effective
3. Has the task been completed? (true/false)

Do not include any other information in your response.
Return in JSON format directly.

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}

*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give a decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:
"""

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

{
    "reasoning": str, # the reasoning process
    "summary": str, # the summary of the vital information of action history with detailed position number and other parameters, which not included in task description.
    "task_status": bool, # whether the task is completed
}


Now let's evaluate the #RL-Recommended-Action taken for this task.

Task Description:
Move to the location near 0, -60, 0

Current Milestone:
['Reach the position [0, -60, 0]']

Actions and Observations:

Thought: To reach the position [0, -60, 0], I need to move from my current location [-4, -60, 1] to the target location. Since I am already at the same y-coordinate, I just need to change my x and z coordinates.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "navigateTo",
  "action_input": {
    "player_name": "Alice",
    "x": 0,
    "y": -60,
    "z": 0
  }
}
```

{'message': ' move to 0 -60 0', 'new_events': ['My inventory: fishing_rod: 1 heldItem: fishing_rod '], 'status': True}

#RL-Recommended-Action:
placeBlock

Please analyze:
1. Does the current #RL-Recommended-Action match the most recent LLM action? Is it reasonable?
2. Rate the #RL-Recommended-Action with a reward:
   -2: Definitely wrong
   -1: Useless/irrelevant
    0: Potentially useful
    1: Useful
    2: Highly effective
3. Has the task been completed? (true/false)

Do not include any other information in your response.
Return in JSON format directly.

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}

*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give a decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

{
    "reasoning": str, # the reasoning process
    "summary": str, # the summary of the vital information of action history with detailed position number and other parameters, which not included in task description.
    "task_status": bool, # whether the task is completed
}


Now let's evaluate the #RL-Recommended-Action taken for this task.

Task Description:
Move to the location near 0, -60, 0

Current Milestone:
['Reach the location near 0, -60, 0']

Actions and Observations:

Thought: To accomplish the task, I need to move to the location near 0, -60, 0, which is indicated by the "Welcome to fishing spot" sign. Since I am currently at position [0, -59, 2], I need to move down to reach the target location.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "navigateTo",
  "action_input": {
    "player_name": "Alice",
    "x": 0,
    "y": -60,
    "z": 1
  }
}
```

#RL-Recommended-Action:
fetchContainerContents

Please analyze:
1. Does the current #RL-Recommended-Action match the most recent LLM action? Is it reasonable?
2. Rate the #RL-Recommended-Action with a reward:
   -2: Definitely wrong
   -1: Useless/irrelevant
    0: Potentially useful
    1: Useful
    2: Highly effective
3. Has the task been completed? (true/false)

Do not include any other information in your response.

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}

*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give a decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:
"""

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:
"""

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:
"""

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:
"""

**Entity:** Alice is located at position [-4, -59, 1] and is holding a diamond sword.

Prompt : You are a helpful assistant in Minecraft.
Based on the environment info and the task, extract the key information and summarize the environment info in a concise and informative way.
You should focus on the entities, blocks, and creatures in the environment, and provide a summary of the environment info.

*** The task *** : cook meat in the Minecraft.

The summary of the environment info:
Entity: Tom is located at position [-1, -59, 1] and is holding one spruce plank, Alice is located at position [42, -59, 125].
Blocks: a chest at [-4, -60, 0] facing west, a furnace at [-4, -60, 1] and other bloces.
Creatures: two pigs at [-3, -59, 0] and [-3, -59, 2].
Interactive-Items: a stone pressure plate at [-3, -60, 2], a juggle button at [-3, -60, 3].

The environment info:

*** The task *** : Move to (5, -58, 3). You may need some block or tool to get to that position, you can find them in the inventory.cannot find the specific sign within 16 blocks.
Return with Entity, Blocks, Creatures and Interactive-Items, and give all these position of these blocks and entities like chest, crafting table, furnace, animals, and plants.



-----------
Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:
"""
the environment information around:
Summary of the environment info:
- **Entity**: Alice is located at position [-10, -59, 13] and is holding 10 dirt blocks.
- **Blocks**: 
  - grass_block at [-11, -61, 12], [-12, -61, 12], [-11, -61, 13]
  - dirt at [-10, -61, 12], [-10, -61, 14], [-9, -61, 10]
  - glass at [0, -60, 12], [0, -59, 12]
- **Sign**: No specific sign found within the specified area.
- **Creatures**: None found nearby.
- **Interactive-Items**: None found nearby.

**Task**: Move to (5, -58, 3).

To reach the target position (5, -58, 3), Alice will need to:
- Move east by 15 blocks (from x=-10 to x=5).
- Move up by 1 block (from y=-59 to y=-58).
- Move north by
Sign info: cannot find the specific sign within 16 blocks


The high-level task:
{'description': 'Move to (5, -58, 3). You may need some block or tool to get to that position, you can find them in the inventory.', 'meta-data': {}}


Agent ability: (This is just telling you what the agent can do in one step, subtask should be harder than one step)
None
"""
Your response should exclusively include the identified sub-task or the next step intended for the agent to execute.
So, 1 subtasks is the maximum number of subtasks you can give.
Response should contain a list of subtask-structure JSON.

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}


*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.
    "milestones": list[string]. Make it detailed and specific,
    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}

*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.

- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now. 

This is not the first time you are handling the task, so you should give part of decompose subtask-structure json feedback. Here is the query:

You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
- In Minecraft, item can be put in agent's inventory, chest, or on the ground. You can use the item in agent's inventory or chest, but you can not use the item on the ground unless you dig it up first.
- The block at lower place should be placed first, and the block at higher place should be placed later. [x,-60,z] is the lowest place. For example, if a task is placing block at x -57 z, then y  -60, -59 and -58 should be placed first and in order.
- Integration and Finalization: In some tasks, you will need to integrate your individual efforts. For example, when crafting complicated stuff that require various materials, after collecting them, you need to consolidate all the materials with one of players.
- You can stop to generate the subtask-structure json if you think the task need the information from the environment, and you can not get the information from the environment now.

Prompt : Your current mission is to leader all the players and execute a set of specified tasks within the Minecraft environment.
--- Background Information ---
Our system manages the task as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
In this turn, you need to decompose the tasks and arrange them in chronological order. Next turn we will analyse your result json to a graph.

A subtask-structure has the following json component:
{
    "id": int, id of the subtask start from 1,
    "description": string, description of the subtask, more detail than a name, for example, place block need position and facing, craft or collect items need the number of items.

    "retrieval paths": list[string], [~/...] task data is a dict or list, please give the relative path to the data, for example, if the data useful is {"c": 1} dict is {"meta-data": {"blueprint": [{"c": 1}, ]}}, the retrieval path is "~/meta-data/blueprint/0",
    "required subtasks": list[int], if this subtask is directly prerequisite for other subtasks before it, list the subtask id here.
    "assigned agents": list[string], name of agents. dispatch the subtask to the agents.
}

*** Important Notice ***
- The system do not allow agents communicate with each other, so you need to make sure the subtasks are independent.
- Sub-task Dispatch: Post decomposition, the next step is to distribute the sub-tasks amongst yourselves. This will require further communication, where you consider each player's skills, resources, and availability. Ensure the dispatch facilitates smooth, ** parallel ** execution.
- Task Decomposition: These sub-tasks should be small, specific, and executable with MineFlayer code, as you will be using MineFlayer to play MineCraft. The task decomposition will not be a one-time process but an iterative one. At regular intervals during playing the game, agents will be paused and you will plan again based on their progress. You'll propose new sub-tasks that respond to the current circumstances. So you don't need to plan far ahead, but make sure your proposed sub-tasks are small, simple and achievable, to ensure smooth progression. Each sub-task should contribute to the completion of the overall task. That means, the number of sub-tasks should no more than numbers of agents. When necessary, the sub-tasks can be identical for faster task accomplishment. Be specific for the sub-tasks, for example, make sure to specify how many materials are needed.
